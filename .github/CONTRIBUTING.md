## Development Setup
To set up the project locally for development, follow these steps:

Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

If you plan on making database changes, use Prisma migrations and ensure that the schema remains consistent.

## Style Guidelines
### Code Style
This project follows a clean and consistent code style to ensure readability and maintainability. Here are some key points to follow:

- TypeScript: Always use TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Linting: Use ESLint for linting the project. Run lint checks before submitting a PR:
```bash
npm run lint
```
- Formatting: The project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting. Please run Prettier before committing:
```bash
npm run format
```
- Comments: Write clear comments where necessary, especially for complex code.
  
## File and Folder Structure
Organize files and folders meaningfully:

- Components: Place reusable React components in the src/components/ directory.
- Pages: Define pages for Next.js in the src/pages/ directory.
- Hooks: Custom React hooks should go in the src/hooks/ directory.
- Database: Prisma-related files are stored in the prisma/ folder.
  
## Commit Message Guidelines
Clear and concise commit messages help in keeping track of changes. Follow these rules when writing commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.
